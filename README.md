# Customer-Churn-Analysis

This project aims to analyze customer churn behaviour and build predictive models to identify customers likely to discontinue services. By understanding churn patterns, businesses can implement strategies to improve customer retention and reduce revenue loss. 

The main objective of this projects are:
    Perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis(EDA),
    Identify key features influencing customer churn, 
    Build classification models to predict churn.

Tools and technologies used were: 
Python,
Pandas for data manipulation,
NumPy for numerical operations,
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization,
Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation,
Jupyter Notebook used as a developmental environment. 

Model evaluation metrices: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.

The final models provide insight into customer behaviour and offer a reliable basis for churn prediction, supporting strategic business decisions.
